<h2 id='notes_from_visiting_the_national_business_park'>Notes from Visiting the National Business Park</h2>

<p>At the main office of the National Security Agency, there is a <a href='http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/vigilance_park/index.shtml'>small park</a> dedicated to the “silent warriors” of airborne signals intelligence. Three previously classified models of planes and plaques with the names of fallen warriors stand in counterpoint to Crypto City. There are signs in front of the planes that explain appropriate photography one is allowed to take—and that illustrate precisely the kind of photo one isn’t allowed to take.</p>

<p>As I looked at this image of an image I couldn’t capture, I wondered if this was why, when asked to illustrate the NSA, the media frequently uses the same stock photo that, my friend Jeff pointed out, looks kind of like the kabba. It’s not journalistic laziness, there just aren’t enough photos <em>out there</em> of the building. In the empty Vigilance Park, I considered risking it and snagging a quick shot, but my day was just beginning and I didn’t want to risk confiscation of my camera that early. I hadn’t come out to suburban Maryland to visit the NSA anyway—this was a detour. I’d come to visit a place far less blatantly sinister.</p>

	<p>The National Business Park is an office complex located less than a mile away from the NSA headquarters. Its tenants are, mostly, intelligence and defense contractors. While the NSA and other intelligence agencies get a lot of attention and scrutiny for creating the surveillance state, contractors play a major role in building it&#8211;they design and maintain software and hardware, provide analysis, and even build <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facility'>physical structures</a> for the intelligence community.</p>

<p>The oldest property in the office park has been there since 1990, but many of the buildings were built after 1998, when a new real estate company acquired the property.</p>

	<section id = "sat-2006">
	<p>Between 2002 and 2006, 1,102,940 square feet of office space in 8 new buildings were added to the National Business Park. 2002 was the same year that the NSA began the notoriously expensive <a href='http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-01-29/news/0601280286_1_intelligence-experts-11-intelligence-trailblazer'>Project Trailblazer</a>, which involved SAIC, Boeing, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), and Booz Allen Hamilton. A year before, CSC and Northrop Grumman had been awarded a joint contract from the NSA to work on <a href='http://www.crocodyl.org/spies_for_hire/project_groundbreaker_nsa_contract'>Project Groundbreaker</a>, another NSA boondoggle that involved subcontracting to, among others, General Dynamics, BAE Systems, Titan Corp. (now L-3 Communications Inc.), CACI International, TRW , Mantech, Lockheed Martin, and Verizon. According to researcher and author Tim Shorrock, contracting makes up about 70% of the defense intelligence budget.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id = "sat-2013">
	<p>Between 2006 and 2013, 9 new buildings and 1,142,023 square feet of office space were added. In that time, Trailblazer was shut down after whistleblower Thomas Drake leaked documents about the program and other major NSA violations of civil liberties. Drake faced prosecution from the U.S. government under the Espionage Act for his whistleblowing. Between 2006 and 2013, the government budget for intelligence went up by 25%. (It is, based on documents published by the <em>Washington Post</em>, currently $52.6 billion). Currently, 3 new buildings are in the process of being constructed at NBP.</p>

	<p>I decided to visit the National Business Park to see whether its physical architecture revealed anything about the architecture of surveillance. In some way it served as perverse pilgrimage, a weird act of affirmation to a cult I only understood in glimpsed fragments. In order to understand a world in which one assumes she is being watched, I needed to face the apparatuses of watching&#8211;I needed to see and be seen by it in an explicit, literal way, not just as more metadata but as a corporeal creature. Searching for a face to, well, face among these lost temples of the surveillance state proved harder than I imagined.</p>

<p>The National Business Park is one of many properties belonging to <a href='http://copt.com'>Corporate Office Properties Trust</a>, a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) based in Columbia, Maryland. COPT traces its origins to a small Minneapolist-based REIT named Royale Investments, founded in 1988. In 1998 the company merged with Constellation Real Estate Group, a fully-owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy. This merger led to the acquisition of 1.6 million square feet of office property (including what would become the National Business Park), a new President and COO, <a href='http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-interview-randall-griffin-20111119,0,4852097.story'>Randall Griffith</a>, and a dramatic shift in business priorities.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id = "coordinateleap-properties">
	<p>COPT explicitly describes itself in its marketing and its annual SEC filing as &#8220;serving the specialized requirements of U.S. Government agencies and defense contractors engaged in defense information technology and national security-related activities.&#8221; Looking at where COPT owns properties in the United States is a really easy way to identify major nodes in the intelligence-industrial complex&#8211;its portfolio includes sites in, for instance, San Antonio, Texas (a stone&#8217;s throw from the National Cryptologic Center) and Colorado Springs, Colorado (just a little ways away from NORTHCOM). While lots of major real estate companies have identified this market of next-to-government-facilities as profitable, COPT is seemingly the only one explicitly and almost exclusively dedicating itself to that market.</p>

<p>The National Business Park’s annualized rental revenue is $107,548,246. As noted in a COPT 2010 presentation from the Smart Procurement conference, over 60% of the top 50 intelligence contractors are tenants in COPT properties.</p>

<p>I initially became interested in the National Business Park after going on a trip to Fort Meade to <a href='http://lifewinning.com/longreads/wordsmeanthings'>attend the trial</a> of Chelsea Manning. At the time, I couldn’t stop telling people about the landscape—or, more specifically, about how little there was to say about the landscape. Suburban Maryland was so perversely boring that I couldn’t stop looking at it, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I decided to learn more about its inhabitants. As I learned more about the world of defense and intelligence contracting, it became clear the NBP was a bit of a mecca&#8211;or, at least, a clever narrative device for framing an inventory of top intelligence contractors. Both James Bamford, in <em>The Shadow Factory</em>, and Tim Shorrock in <em>Spies for Hire</em> make reference to NBP. Little is said about the owners of the property, and what writing is out there is admittedly dry business reporting type stuff. They are often vague about their own practices&#8211;press releases about new buildings will mention &#8221;<a href='http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130903-903335.html'>a strategic tenant</a>&#8221; at a new building they&#8217;ve broken ground on, and in one <a href='http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/2005/07/13/Property-Report-The-secret-business-of-building-spy-buildings/stories/200507130209'>article</a> COPT claims to not always know who its tenants are.</p>

<p>Depending on how you search for the National Business Park, you&#8217;ll get a few different answers for where it actually is. Technically, it&#8217;s in Annapolis Junction, an unincorporated community in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. But community is a generous definition. Annapolis Junction is a cipher of a place&#8211;named for a a rail junction on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1840, most of the land that made up &#8220;Annapolis Junction&#8221; was repurposed by the government to create Fort Meade in 1917. Industrial facilities and offices, the CSX rail line, and of course Fort Meade make up the majority of its &#8220;community.&#8221; According to the 2010 Census, 2 people were recorded as living in its zip code, 20701. To call it liminal would imply a potentiality that it does not have. It is merely there.</p>

	<p>While its proximity and relationship to the NSA is a primary draw for learning about the National Business Park, it&#8217;s also about 3 miles away from what used to be the Maryland House of Corrections, a state prison in Jessup, Maryland. The House of Corrections, also known as &#8220;The Cut&#8221;, was notorious for its poor conditions and history of violence. It was <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/18/AR2007031800137.html'>closed</a>, with minimal notice, in 2007, and its 842 inmates were transferred elsewhere. In 2012, it was <a href='http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-07-14/news/bs-md-maryland-house-of-corrections-20120714_1_jessup-prison-inmates-prison-system'>torn down</a>. The Maryland Correctional Institute for Women, the only women&#8217;s prison facility in the entire state, still operates near the former House Of Corrections, as does the minimum security Brockbridge Center. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons has its <a href='http://www.bop.gov/about/ro/mxr/index.jsp'>mid-Atlantic regional office</a> in the National Business Park, sharing space with small-to-midlevel intelligence contractors like <a href='http://www.scitorcorporation.com/'>Scitor</a>, <a href='http://www.g2-inc.com/'>G2</a>, <a href='http://www.invertix.com/'>Invertix</a> (recently rebranded as Altamira), and <a href='http://www.vsi-corp.com/'>Ventura Solutions</a>. To have facilities associated with the surveillance industry within close proximity to a place where people are, paradoxically, both under obsessive surveillance and disappeared from society, is merely a matter of resonance, not collusion.</p>

	<section id = "streetview">
	<p>Before I actually went to the National Business Park, I went there remotely on Google Streetview. The tours I took myself on offered some insight into the primary tenants of the NBP and its general flatness, but several streets were out of Streetview range, and it was almost a year and a half old. As preparation, I trawled poorly designed websites for <a href='http://www.gpapc.net/commerical/commercial.htm'>architecture firms</a>, looking for construction and tenant histories through press releases, SEC filings, and dozens of corporate websites.</p>

<p>Partly out of curiosity, I did reach out to the National Business Park&#8217;s property manager Bill Barroll to see if anyone would be available to answer questions and chat about the park&#8217;s art and architecture (based on the one <a href='http://artcfa.wordpress.com/2011/10/18/the-sculpture-garden-at-the-national-business-park/'>blog post</a> from an <a href='http://artcfa.com/artists-circle-fine-art-portfolio/art-consulting-framing-installation-clients/'>art consulting company</a> that, apparently, is responsible for much of the aesthetics of the intelligence industry). I never heard from Barroll, but another COPT employee responded, asking for all questions in advance and where I planned to publish, as a board needed to decide if this was an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; they wanted to take. After I sent 4 fairly vanilla questions, several more requests were made (for another method of contact beyond my email, for a draft of whatever I wrote in advance of publication). It seemed like working through official channels might prove a greater hindrance to the work. I abandoned the correspondence.</p>

	<section id = "transition-10">
	<p>I&#8217;d built the NBP up so much that upon finally arriving I felt a strange deja vu. The landscapes I&#8217;d paused and panned through on Google Streetview I now viewed through the cinematizing screen of a car window. I had to keep moving, and in my distracted euphoria of <em>finally</em> seeing that Booz Allen Hamilton office <em>for real</em> and trying to keep my eyes on the road, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to turn off and park anywhere to begin actually exploring. So I drove to the end of the park, where the three newest additions to the National Business Park sit. In Google Satellite, the buildings at the edge of the National Business Park don&#8217;t exist. In Streetview, they&#8217;re under construction. This disconnect, combined with the absence of really reliable information about tenants, also made going to the edge of the park first a fact-finding task. I had a partially constructed building in Google Street View and a real estate broker&#8217;s <a href='http://www.aegispg.com/sectors/detail2.php?property_id=95&amp;sector_id=101&amp;property_name=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%20-%20410%20National%20Business%20Parkway'>portfolio site</a> as conjecture that 410 was home to Lockheed Martin offices, but wasn&#8217;t sure if the offices were completed and people were actually working in them. The Lockheed logo now on the side of the building and the medium-full parking lot suggested it was in use. The interior of 420 was still under construction. Apparently, it is the future home of <a href='http://www.sgi.com/global/'>SGI Federal</a>.</p>

	<section id = "pond">
	<p>I didn&#8217;t anticipate how much of a publicly used space the park actually was. There were joggers and power walkers. There were people on smoke breaks, some in military uniform, at picnic tables outside buildings. There were people walking from one office to another&#8211;it was, after all, a lovely day. A steady stream of carszipped around the office park throughout the afternoon, as well as a network of white shuttle buses. It’s not clear if they were government operated or privately run. In the parallel narrative I began to construct, COPT&#8217;s cageiness about discussing its art collection with me was a result of it being not an art collection at all, but a series of altars for the hidden ancient cults that in fact ruled their properties. I walked along the parkway to a fetid pond and another sculpture. Neither the altar, nor the ducks in the pond, seemed to get many visitors. They offered no insight into the secrets of these temples.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section id = "restricted-areas">
	<p>Surprisingly few buildings had clear sight lines. Rambling topography and highly curated foliage meant that a direct view was almost impossible for many structures without higher elevation or getting close&#8211;and I didn&#8217;t know how close I could get without drawing attention to myself. Not that it was clear how much more I&#8217;d learn from going up close beyond what I could learn from the photographs published on COPT&#8217;s website. Beneath their bland exteriors lay more bland copper and drywall, security blanketed in banality.</p>

<p>Visiting in person, I understood why some of the NBP was not part of Street View&#8211;they were mostly restricted areas. From what I&#8217;d found in my research it seemed the higher the level of restriction at a site, the more likely the property was being used by the U.S. Government. I didn&#8217;t even try to shoot pictures of the barricades and ID booth at Hercules Road, the path to a building that <a href='cryptome.org/eyeball/nsa-nbp/nsa-nbp.htm'>according to James Bamford</a>&#8217;s <em>The Shadow Factory</em> is rented by the NSA&#8217;s Technology and Sytems Organization, where it has been <a href='https://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/oldind.html'>since 1996</a>. Similarly, while Sentinel <em>Drive</em> was accessible, Sentinel <em>Way</em> was only accessible with proper ID and credentials. Based on the vagueness of press releases and searching for information on tenants of the Sentinel Way buildings, they appear to be mostly government. Few of these departments appear to have address information online, but the <a href='http://www.netc.navy.mil/centers/ceninfodom/ftmeade/'>Department of the Navy’s Center for Information Dominance</a> does appear to be in one of the Sentinel Way buildings.</p>
