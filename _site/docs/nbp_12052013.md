The architecture of surveillance
================================

At the headquarters of the National Security Agency in Fort Meade, Maryland, there is a [small park](http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/vigilance_park/index.shtml) dedicated to the “silent warriors” of airborne signals intelligence. Signs explain rules about photographs one can take --- and illustrate the kind of photo one isn’t allowed to take. 

Looking at the image of an impossible image reminded me of the ubiquitous [stock photograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:National_Security_Agency_headquarters,_Fort_Meade,_Maryland.jpg) of the NSA, the one reminiscent of the [Kaaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mosqu%C3%A9e_Masjid_el_Haram_%C3%A0_la_Mecque.jpg) and among the few used by news outlets. The photograph’s ubiquity, and its resemblance to another opaque monument, serve as shorthand for an institution that seeks to be perceived as beyond human comprehension or accountability. 

My pilgrimage was, however, to adjacent temples of lesser gods. The National Business Park is an office complex located less than a mile away from the NSA headquarters. Its tenants are, mostly, intelligence and defense contractors. While the U.S. intelligence community has been subject to public scrutiny following revelations about the surveillance state, contractors are crucial to maintaining it --- they design and build software and hardware, provide analysis, and build physical structures for the intelligence community. According to author Tim Shorrock, contracting makes up about 70 percent of the defense intelligence budget.

The landscape of the National Business Park offers little insight into hard, technical facts of the surveillance state. But plausible deniability is itself an architectural choice, one made manifest not only in procurements and mergers, not only in networks and protocols, but also in drywall and concrete and stock photography. In order to understand a world in which surveillance is deemed an unexceptional fact, it seemed necessary to face the apparatuses of watching in the most literal, prosaic way possible.

The National Business Park is one of many properties belonging to [Corporate Office Properties Trust](http://copt.com), or COPT, a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust based in Columbia, Md. COPT traces its origins to a Minneapolis firm, Royale Investments, founded in 1988. In 1998, the company merged with Constellation Real Estate Group, a fully-owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy. This merger led to the acquisition of 1.6 million square feet of mid-Atlantic office property, a new name and a shift in business priorities.

COPT describes itself as "serving the specialized requirements of U.S. Government agencies and defense contractors engaged in defense information technology and national security-related activities."  While there are, of course, other real estate companies working in this niche, COPT is seemingly the only one explicitly and almost exclusively dedicating itself to it. 

For intelligence-industry researchers, the National Business Park is a kind of a mecca in its own right, providing a clever [narrative device](cryptome.org/eyeball/nsa-nbp/nsa-nbp.htm) for [writing](http://www.salon.com/2013/06/10/digital_blackwater_meet_the_contractors_who_analyze_your_personal_data/) about contractors. COPT itself is rarely in the spotlight. Press releases about new buildings will mention "[a new strategic tenant](http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130903-903335.html)," nothing else. At times, COPT [claims](http://www.post-gazette.com/businessnews/2005/07/13/Property-Report-The-secret-business-of-building-spy-buildings/stories/200507130209) to not always know who its tenants are.

The National Business Park is located in Annapolis Junction, an unincorporated community in Anne Arundel County. “Community” is perhaps a generous definition. Annapolis Junction itself is a cipher of a place --- named in 1840 for a rail junction on the B&O Railroad, the government repurposed most of the surrounding land to create Fort Meade in 1917. Industrial facilities, offices, the CSX rail line and Fort Meade make up the majority of its "community." To call it liminal would imply a potentiality that it does not have. It is merely there. 

While the NSA is a notable neighbor, the National Business Park is also about three miles away from what used to be a state prison in Jessup. The Maryland House of Corrections, also known as "The Cut," was notorious for its poor conditions and history of violence. It [closed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/18/AR2007031800137.html) abruptly in 2007, and was [torn down](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-07-14/news/bs-md-maryland-house-of-corrections-20120714_1_jessup-prison-inmates-prison-system) in 2012. The Maryland Correctional Institute for Women still operates nearby, as does the minimum security Brockbridge Center. 

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons has its [mid-Atlantic regional office](http://www.bop.gov/about/ro/mxr/index.jsp) in the National Business Park, sharing space with small-to-midlevel contractors like [Scitor](http://www.scitorcorporation.com/), [G2](http://www.g2-inc.com/), [Invertix](http://www.invertix.com/) (recently rebranded as Altamira) and [Ventura Solutions](http://www.vsi-corp.com/). 

That the intelligence-industrial complex overlaps with that of the prison-industrial complex reveals something, but something that remains inescapably inchoate, an uneasy resonance even if not actual collusion.

Arriving at the National Business Park induced intense deja vu for me --- not for the lived experience, but the simulation of it. Before actually going to the National Business Park, I went there remotely on Google Streetview. The landscapes I'd paused and panned now appeared through the cinematizing screen of a car window. In the distracted euphoria of *finally* seeing that Booz Allen Hamilton office *for real*, I couldn't bring myself to stop and park. I drove to the end of the parkway instead.

In Google Satellite, the buildings at the edge of the National Business Park don't exist. A real estate broker's [portfolio site](http://www.aegispg.com/sectors/detail2.php?property_id=95&sector_id=101&property_name=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%20-%20410%20National%20Business%20Parkway) indicates that 410 was home to Lockheed Martin offices, which are apparently completed and in use. The interior of 420 is still under construction. Apparently, it is the future home of [SGI Federal](http://www.sgi.com/global/).

Walking along the parkway itself, I began to imagine that the banality of the landscape hid ancient cults that in fact ruled the office park. At the base of a hill, I approached a fetid pond and an abstract sculpture. Neither the altar, nor the ducks in the pond, offered insight into the secrets of these temples.

The higher the level of restriction at a site, apparently, the more likely the tenant was the U.S. government. I didn't even try to photograph the barricades and ID booth at Hercules Road, the path to NBP-1, a building rented by [the NSA's Technology and Sytems Organization](https://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/oldind.html). Similarly, while Sentinel *Drive* was accessible, Sentinel *Way* required proper ID and credentials. Old press releases suggest they are mostly government offices, including the [Department of the Navy’s Center for Information Dominance](http://www.netc.navy.mil/centers/ceninfodom/ftmeade/). 

I ventured to Technology Drive, a name for a street that no one would ever have a childhood on. Office parks are fond of buzzwords as addresses --- Innovation Road, New Allegiance Drive. There were some strangely quaint names well. The sculpture garden by the Lockheed Martin office featured a plaque explaining the land used to be the "Trusty Friend Farm," established in 1829 by Amos Clark, preserved as farmland until 1989.

On the 2701 Technology Drive compound, I entered a median courtyard with yet another sculpture, a circle formed by three curving stalks meandering toward the sky. I stood in its center and looked up.

“They are not built for the ages, but rather against the ages," wrote Robert Smithson in "[Entropy and the New Monuments](http://www.robertsmithson.com/essays/entropy_and.htm). "They are involved in a systematic reduction of time down to fractions of seconds, rather than in representing the long space of centuries. Both past and future are placed into an objective present.” 

The buildings were sleeping giants that should be approached with great caution. The buildings were bland temples to the many demigods of an infinitely complicated cult. The buildings were buildings, decked in surveillance cameras and filled with humans doing their jobs.

Outside one of Booz Allen's offices at 304 Sentinel Drive, a man driving a pickup truck with the COPT logo told me I couldn't take photos. I asked if I could at least photograph the sculptures. "As long as you can't see the buildings," he said. I was doubtful that I'd actually be stopped from photographing more, but still went back to my rental car and, in a paranoid flourish, hid my camera's memory card.

In part, it is this dynamic that gives surveillance its power --- of uncertainty as to whether you are being observed, and whether you will be punished for your actions, whether or not they actually pose a danger to anyone. Photographs, maps and descriptions of office buildings in Maryland aren't especially tactically valuable. The only reason to deny anyone the right to take photographs of the National Business Park or the NSA or any apparatus connected to the intelligence community is to maintain a false mystique around it. 

This is but one among many manicured landscapes of the intelligence industry. It presents a surface, smooth and menacing like a human face with no features. But someone had to build that surface, someone has to maintain and manicure it, someone has to tether the sad sapling trees on the medians. Through its banal manicured landscape, its vacuous monuments, and insistence on image control, the National Business Park creates a landscape that denies any rational past, a landscape for bodies beyond not only the politics of the day but also the accountability of history. 

As I left the National Business Park, I thought again of Smithson. “It seems that beyond the barrier, there are only more barriers.” I’d gone to the outskirts of Crypto City and found only ciphers.
