<p>I didn&#8217;t anticipate how much of a publicly used space the park actually was. There were joggers and power walkers. There were people on smoke breaks, some in military uniform, at picnic tables outside buildings. There were people walking from one office to another&#8211;it was, after all, a lovely day. A steady stream of carszipped around the office park throughout the afternoon, as well as a network of white shuttle buses. Itâ€™s not clear if they were government operated or privately run. In the parallel narrative I began to construct, COPT&#8217;s cageiness about discussing its art collection with me was a result of it being not an art collection at all, but a series of altars for the hidden ancient cults that in fact ruled their properties. I walked along the parkway to a fetid pond and another sculpture. Neither the altar, nor the ducks in the pond, seemed to get many visitors. They offered no insight into the secrets of these temples.</p>
