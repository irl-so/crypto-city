<p>I&#8217;d built the NBP up so much that upon finally arriving I felt a strange deja vu. The landscapes I&#8217;d paused and panned through on Google Streetview I now viewed through the cinematizing screen of a car window. I had to keep moving, and in my distracted euphoria of <em>finally</em> seeing that Booz Allen Hamilton office <em>for real</em> and trying to keep my eyes on the road, I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to turn off and park anywhere to begin actually exploring. So I drove to the end of the park, where the three newest additions to the National Business Park sit. In Google Satellite, the buildings at the edge of the National Business Park don&#8217;t exist. In Streetview, they&#8217;re under construction. This disconnect, combined with the absence of really reliable information about tenants, also made going to the edge of the park first a fact-finding task. I had a partially constructed building in Google Street View and a real estate broker&#8217;s <a href='http://www.aegispg.com/sectors/detail2.php?property_id=95&amp;sector_id=101&amp;property_name=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%20-%20410%20National%20Business%20Parkway'>portfolio site</a> as conjecture that 410 was home to Lockheed Martin offices, but wasn&#8217;t sure if the offices were completed and people were actually working in them. The Lockheed logo now on the side of the building and the medium-full parking lot suggested it was in use. The interior of 420 was still under construction. Apparently, it is the future home of <a href='http://www.sgi.com/global/'>SGI Federal</a>.</p>
