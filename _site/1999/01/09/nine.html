<p>Before I actually went to the National Business Park, I went there remotely on Google Streetview. The tours I took myself on offered some insight into the primary tenants of the NBP and its general flatness, but several streets were out of Streetview range, and it was almost a year and a half old. As preparation, I trawled poorly designed websites for <a href='http://www.gpapc.net/commerical/commercial.htm'>architecture firms</a>, looking for construction and tenant histories through press releases, SEC filings, and dozens of corporate websites.</p>

<p>Partly out of curiosity, I did reach out to the National Business Park&#8217;s property manager Bill Barroll to see if anyone would be available to answer questions and chat about the park&#8217;s art and architecture (based on the one <a href='http://artcfa.wordpress.com/2011/10/18/the-sculpture-garden-at-the-national-business-park/'>blog post</a> from an <a href='http://artcfa.com/artists-circle-fine-art-portfolio/art-consulting-framing-installation-clients/'>art consulting company</a> that, apparently, is responsible for much of the aesthetics of the intelligence industry). I never heard from Barroll, but another COPT employee responded, asking for all questions in advance and where I planned to publish, as a board needed to decide if this was an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; they wanted to take. After I sent 4 fairly vanilla questions, several more requests were made (for another method of contact beyond my email, for a draft of whatever I wrote in advance of publication). It seemed like working through official channels might prove a greater hindrance to the work. I abandoned the correspondence.</p>
