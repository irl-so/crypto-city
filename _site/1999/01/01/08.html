<p>While the NSA is a notable neighbor, the NPB is also about 3 miles away from what used to be a state prison in Jessup. The Maryland House of Corrections, also known as &#8220;The Cut&#8221;, was notorious for its poor conditions and history of violence. It <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/18/AR2007031800137.html'>closed</a> abruptly in 2007, and <a href='http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-07-14/news/bs-md-maryland-house-of-corrections-20120714_1_jessup-prison-inmates-prison-system'>torn down</a> in 2012. The Maryland Correctional Institute for Women, the only women&#8217;s prison in the entire state, still operates near the former House Of Corrections, as does the minimum security Brockbridge Center.</p>

<p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons has its <a href='http://www.bop.gov/about/ro/mxr/index.jsp'>mid-Atlantic regional office</a> in the National Business Park, sharing space with small-to-midlevel contractors like <a href='http://www.scitorcorporation.com/'>Scitor</a>, <a href='http://www.g2-inc.com/'>G2</a>, <a href='http://www.invertix.com/'>Invertix</a> (recently rebranded as Altamira), and <a href='http://www.vsi-corp.com/'>Ventura Solutions</a>.</p>

<p>I mention this not to elucidate a larger point but to acknowledge one that remains inchoate yet inescapable. The physical geography of the intelligence-industrial complex overlapping with that of the prison-industrial complex is a matter of resonance, not collusion.</p>
