<p>Before actually going to the National Business Park, I went there remotely on Google Streetview. Panning and scrolling the parkway offered some insight, but some streets were not included. I also emailed the National Business Park&#8217;s property manager Bill Barroll to see if he was available for an interview. Another COPT employee responsed, asking for all questions in advance and where I planned to publish, as a board needed to decide if this was an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; they wanted to take. After submitting my 4 fairly vanilla questions, several more requests were made (another method of contact beyond email, a draft in advance of publication). Apparently, COPT would happily work with me if it served their needs. I abandoned the correspondence.</p>
