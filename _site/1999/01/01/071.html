<p>Right on the border of Fort Meade, the National Business Park is located in Annapolis Junction, an unincorporated community in Anne Arundel County. “Community” is perhaps a generous definition. Annapolis Junction is a cipher of a place&#8211;named in 1840 for a rail junction on the B&amp;O Railroad, the government repurposed most of the surrounding land to create Fort Meade in 1917. Industrial facilities, offices, the CSX rail line, and Fort Meade make up the majority of its &#8220;community.&#8221; To call it liminal would imply a potentiality that it does not have. It is merely there.</p>
