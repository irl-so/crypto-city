<p>Sentinel Drive was the only publicly accessible area beyond Street View’s confines. There, mostly vacant parking garages slouched obstinately. This overwhelming presence of absence was made more obscene by the fact NBP has “overflow parking” on the NSA grounds less than a mile away (accessed via Technology Drive, which takes the name “Connector Road” as it enters Fort Meade ). I drove into one of the parking garages, to the top level, to see if I could get a better vantage point. Trees obscured cars zipping along Connector Drive to the NSA. NBP-1 loomed over the compound.</p>

<p>Outside one of Booz Allen’s offices at 304 Sentinel Drive, a man driving a pickup truck with the COPT logo told me I couldn’t take photos. I asked if I could photograph the sculptures. “As long as you can’t see the buildings,” he said. I was doubtful that I’d actually be stopped from photographing more, but still went back to my rental car and, in a paranoid flourish, hid my camera’s memory card.</p>
