<p>Sentinel Drive was the only publicly accessible area beyond Street Viewâ€™s confines. There, mostly vacant parking garages slouched obstinately. This overwhelming presence of absence was made more obscene by the fact NBP has &#8220;overflow parking&#8221; on the NSA grounds less than a mile away (accessed via Technology Drive, which takes the name &#8220;Connector Road&#8221; as it enters Fort Meade ). I drove into one of the parking garages, to the top level, to see if I could get a better vantage point. Trees obscured cars zipping along Connector Drive to the NSA. NBP-1 loomed over the compound.</p>

<p>Outside one of Booz Allen&#8217;s offices at 304 Sentinel Drive, a man driving a pickup truck with the COPT logo told me I couldn&#8217;t take photos. I asked if I could photograph the sculptures. &#8220;As long as you can&#8217;t see the buildings,&#8221; he said. I was doubtful that I&#8217;d actually be stopped from photographing more, but still went back to my rental car and, in a paranoid flourish, hid my camera&#8217;s memory card.</p>
