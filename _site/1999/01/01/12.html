<p>It became clear why some of the NBP was not part of Street View–they were mostly restricted areas. Apparently the higher the level of restriction at a site, the more likely the tenant was the U.S. government. I didn’t even try to shoot pictures of the barricades and ID booth at Hercules Road, the path to NBP-1, a building rented by the NSA’s <a href="http://cryptome.org/eyeball/nsa-nbp/nsa-nbp.htm">Technology and Sytems Organization</a> where it has been <a href="https://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/oldind.html">since 1996</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, while Sentinel <em>Drive</em> was accessible, Sentinel <em>Way</em> required proper ID and credentials. Past press releases and research suggest they are mostly government offices, including the <a href="http://www.netc.navy.mil/centers/ceninfodom/ftmeade/">Department of the Navy’s Center for Information Dominance</a>.</p>
