<p>From Hercules Road I ventured to Technology Drive, a name for a street that no one would ever have a childhood on. Office parks are fond of these buzzword-heavy addresses&#8211;Innovation Road, New Allegiance Drive. There were some strangely quaint street names in NBP as well, presumably references to the farms that may have once been there&#8211;the sculpture garden by the Lockheed Martin office featured a plaque explaining the land used to be the &#8220;Trusty Friend Farm&#8221;, established in 1829 by Amos Clark, preserved as farmland until 1989.</p>

<p>On the 2701 Technology Drive compound, I entered a median courtyard with yet another sculpture. This one was a circle formed by three curving stalks meandering toward the sky. I stood in its center and looked up. Maybe if I knew the correct incantations, the correct syntax, I might be able to activate the sculpture and reveal its true purpose.</p>

<p>I thought about Robert Smithson’s <a href='http://www.robertsmithson.com/essays/entropy_and.htm'>Entropy and the New Monuments</a>: “They are not built for the ages, but rather against the ages. They are involved in a systematic reduction of time down to fractions of seconds, rather than in representing the long space of centuries. Both past and future are placed into an objective present.” The buildings were sleeping giants that should be approached with great caution. The buildings were bland temples to the many demigods of an infinitely complicated cult. The buildings were buildings, decked in surveillance cameras and filled with humans, doing their jobs.</p>
