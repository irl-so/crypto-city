<p>In the parallel narrative I began to construct, COPT&#8217;s cageiness about discussing its art collection was because it was actually a series of altars for the hidden ancient cults that in fact ruled their properties. I walked along the parkway to a fetid pond and an abstract sculpture. Neither the altar, nor the ducks in the pond, seemed to get many visitors. They offered no insight into the secrets of these temples.</p>

<p>Rambling topography and highly curated foliage meant that getting a direct view of buildings was almost impossible without higher elevation or getting close. I didn&#8217;t know how close I could get without drawing attention to myself. Not that it was clear I was doing anything wrong per se, or how much more I&#8217;d learn from going up close beyond what I could learn from the photographs on COPT&#8217;s website. Beneath bland exteriors lay more bland copper and drywall, security blanketed in banality.</p>
