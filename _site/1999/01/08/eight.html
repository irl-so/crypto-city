<p>While its proximity and relationship to the NSA is a primary draw for learning about the National Business Park, it&#8217;s also about 3 miles away from what used to be the Maryland House of Corrections, a state prison in Jessup, Maryland. The House of Corrections, also known as &#8220;The Cut&#8221;, was notorious for its poor conditions and history of violence. It was <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/18/AR2007031800137.html'>closed</a>, with minimal notice, in 2007, and its 842 inmates were transferred elsewhere. In 2012, it was <a href='http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-07-14/news/bs-md-maryland-house-of-corrections-20120714_1_jessup-prison-inmates-prison-system'>torn down</a>. The Maryland Correctional Institute for Women, the only women&#8217;s prison facility in the entire state, still operates near the former House Of Corrections, as does the minimum security Brockbridge Center. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons has its <a href='http://www.bop.gov/about/ro/mxr/index.jsp'>mid-Atlantic regional office</a> in the National Business Park, sharing space with small-to-midlevel intelligence contractors like <a href='http://www.scitorcorporation.com/'>Scitor</a>, <a href='http://www.g2-inc.com/'>G2</a>, <a href='http://www.invertix.com/'>Invertix</a> (recently rebranded as Altamira), and <a href='http://www.vsi-corp.com/'>Ventura Solutions</a>. To have facilities associated with the surveillance industry within close proximity to a place where people are, paradoxically, both under obsessive surveillance and disappeared from society, is merely a matter of resonance, not collusion.</p>
