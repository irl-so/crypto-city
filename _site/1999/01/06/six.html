<p>I decided to visit the National Business Park to see whether its physical architecture revealed anything about the architecture of surveillance. In some way it served as perverse pilgrimage, a weird act of affirmation to a cult I only understood in glimpsed fragments. In order to understand a world in which one assumes she is being watched, I needed to face the apparatuses of watching&#8211;I needed to see and be seen by it in an explicit, literal way, not just as more metadata but as a corporeal creature. Searching for a face to, well, face among these lost temples of the surveillance state proved harder than I imagined.</p>

<p>The National Business Park is one of many properties belonging to <a href='http://copt.com'>Corporate Office Properties Trust</a>, a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) based in Columbia, Maryland. COPT traces its origins to a small Minneapolist-based REIT named Royale Investments, founded in 1988. In 1998 the company merged with Constellation Real Estate Group, a fully-owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy. This merger led to the acquisition of 1.6 million square feet of office property (including what would become the National Business Park), a new President and COO, <a href='http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-interview-randall-griffin-20111119,0,4852097.story'>Randall Griffith</a>, and a dramatic shift in business priorities.</p>
