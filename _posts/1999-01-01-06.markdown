Visiting the National Business Park admittedly offers little insight into hard, technical facts of the surveillance state. Studying the facades of the intelligence industry is more an investigation of ethics by way of aesthetics. In order to understand a world in which one assumes she is being watched, it seemed necessary to face the apparatuses of watching--to see and be seen in an explicit, literal way, not just as more metadata but as a corporeal creature. Searching for a face to, well, face among the temples of the surveillance state proved more difficult than imagined.
