Actually arriving at the NBP induced intense deja vuâ€”not for the lived experience, but the simulation of it. The landscapes I'd paused and panned through on Google Streetview now appeared through the cinematizing screen of a car window. In the distracted euphoria of *finally* seeing that Booz Allen Hamilton office *for real*, I couldn't bring myself to stop and park. I drove to the end of the parkway, home to three newer buildings.

In Google Satellite, the buildings at the edge of the National Business Park don't exist. A real estate broker's [portfolio site](http://www.aegispg.com/sectors/detail2.php?property_id=95&sector_id=101&property_name=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%20-%20410%20National%20Business%20Parkway) indicated that 410 was home to Lockheed Martin offices, which are apparently completed and in use. The interior of 420 was still under construction. Apparently, it is the future home of [SGI Federal](http://www.sgi.com/global/).
