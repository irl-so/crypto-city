It became clear why some of the NBP was not part of Street View--they were mostly restricted areas. Apparently the higher the level of restriction at a site, the more likely the tenant was the U.S. government. I didn't even try to shoot pictures of the barricades and ID booth at Hercules Road, the path to NBP-1, a building rented by the NSA's [Technology and Sytems Organization](http://cryptome.org/eyeball/nsa-nbp/nsa-nbp.htm) where it has been [since 1996](https://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/oldind.html).

Similarly, while Sentinel *Drive* was accessible, Sentinel *Way* required proper ID and credentials. Past press releases and research suggest they are mostly government offices, including the [Department of the Navyâ€™s Center for Information Dominance](http://www.netc.navy.mil/centers/ceninfodom/ftmeade/).
