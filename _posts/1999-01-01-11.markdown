In the parallel narrative I began to construct, COPT's cageiness about discussing its art collection was because it was actually a series of altars for the hidden ancient cults that in fact ruled their properties. I walked along the parkway to a fetid pond and an abstract sculpture. Neither the altar, nor the ducks in the pond, seemed to get many visitors. They offered no insight into the secrets of these temples.

Rambling topography and highly curated foliage meant that getting a direct view of buildings was almost impossible without higher elevation or getting close. I didn't know how close I could get without drawing attention to myself. Not that it was clear I was doing anything wrong per se, or how much more I'd learn from going up close beyond what I could learn from the photographs on COPT's website. Beneath bland exteriors lay more bland copper and drywall, security blanketed in banality.
