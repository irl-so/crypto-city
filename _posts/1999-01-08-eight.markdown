While its proximity and relationship to the NSA is a primary draw for learning about the National Business Park, it's also about 3 miles away from what used to be the Maryland House of Corrections, a state prison in Jessup, Maryland. The House of Corrections, also known as "The Cut", was notorious for its poor conditions and history of violence. It was [closed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/18/AR2007031800137.html), with minimal notice, in 2007, and its 842 inmates were transferred elsewhere. In 2012, it was [torn down](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-07-14/news/bs-md-maryland-house-of-corrections-20120714_1_jessup-prison-inmates-prison-system). The Maryland Correctional Institute for Women, the only women's prison facility in the entire state, still operates near the former House Of Corrections, as does the minimum security Brockbridge Center. 
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons has its [mid-Atlantic regional office](http://www.bop.gov/about/ro/mxr/index.jsp) in the National Business Park, sharing space with small-to-midlevel intelligence contractors like [Scitor](http://www.scitorcorporation.com/), [G2](http://www.g2-inc.com/), [Invertix](http://www.invertix.com/) (recently rebranded as Altamira), and [Ventura Solutions](http://www.vsi-corp.com/). 
To have facilities associated with the surveillance industry within close proximity to a place where people are, paradoxically, both under obsessive surveillance and disappeared from society, is merely a matter of resonance, not collusion.
