Right on the border of Fort Meade, the National Business Park is located in Annapolis Junction, an unincorporated community in Anne Arundel County. “Community” is perhaps a generous definition. Annapolis Junction is a cipher of a place--named in 1840 for a rail junction on the B&O Railroad, the government repurposed most of the surrounding land to create Fort Meade in 1917. Industrial facilities, offices, the CSX rail line, and Fort Meade make up the majority of its "community." To call it liminal would imply a potentiality that it does not have. It is merely there.
