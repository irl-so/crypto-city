Between 2006 and 2013, 9 new buildings and 1,142,023 square feet of office space were added. In that time, Trailblazer was shut down after whistleblower Thomas Drake leaked documents about the program  and other major NSA violations of civil liberties. Drake faced prosecution from the U.S. government under the Espionage Act for his whistleblowing. Between 2006 and 2013, the government budget for intelligence went up by 25%.
