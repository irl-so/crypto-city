While the NSA is a notable neighbor, the NPB is also about 3 miles away from what used to be a state prison in Jessup. The Maryland House of Corrections, also known as "The Cut", was notorious for its poor conditions and history of violence. It [closed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/18/AR2007031800137.html) abruptly in 2007, and [torn down](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-07-14/news/bs-md-maryland-house-of-corrections-20120714_1_jessup-prison-inmates-prison-system) in 2012. The Maryland Correctional Institute for Women, the only women's prison in the entire state, still operates near the former House Of Corrections, as does the minimum security Brockbridge Center. 

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons has its [mid-Atlantic regional office](http://www.bop.gov/about/ro/mxr/index.jsp) in the National Business Park, sharing space with small-to-midlevel contractors like [Scitor](http://www.scitorcorporation.com/), [G2](http://www.g2-inc.com/), [Invertix](http://www.invertix.com/) (recently rebranded as Altamira), and [Ventura Solutions](http://www.vsi-corp.com/). 

I mention this not to elucidate a larger point but to acknowledge one that remains inchoate yet inescapable. The physical geography of the intelligence-industrial complex overlapping with that of the prison-industrial complex is a matter of resonance, not collusion.
